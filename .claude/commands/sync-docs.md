Read CLAUDE.md and README before starting. Do not make any changes
until the comparison is complete and you have asked for approval.

You are detecting documentation drift — places where the docs no
longer match the code, or where state that needs documentation is
hiding in the operator's head.

Run all four checks; produce a single drift report at the end.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 1 — CLAUDE.md CURRENCY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

For every entry in CLAUDE.md's Common Gotchas, Key Design Decisions,
and Operator State Checklist (if present):

1. Is the gotcha / decision / state item still true?
   - Verify by reading the relevant file(s).
   - Flag STALE if the underlying code has changed and the doc no
     longer describes current behavior.
   - Flag RESOLVED if the gotcha is no longer reachable (code removed,
     guard added, etc.) — propose deletion or "Resolved on [date]" note.

2. Is anything described in CLAUDE.md that no longer exists in the
   codebase (e.g., a file path that's been moved or removed)?

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 2 — SUBSYSTEM FILE REFERENCE CURRENCY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Read the Subsystems section of CLAUDE.md's Cycle Workflow Config.

For each subsystem:
- Verify every listed file path still exists.
- For each subsystem, scan the project for source files that are
  in that subsystem's domain but NOT listed (new files added since
  the last `/setup-cycle`).
- For Frozen Subsystems: verify the rationale still applies.
- For Deploy Command entries: verify the referenced subsystem name
  still exists in the Subsystems list.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 3 — OPERATOR STATE INVENTORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Look for setup steps that exist only in the operator's head:

- Environment variables, API keys, OAuth scopes the code reads but
  CLAUDE.md / README don't mention as required.
- Manual setup steps implied by code (e.g., "must create a sheet
  named X", "must install trigger Y", "must add the script's
  service-account email to the target spreadsheet").
- Scheduled triggers, cron entries, webhooks that exist in
  production but aren't described in docs.
- One-time migrations or backfills the code expects to have run.

For each item: propose a one-line addition to an "Operator State
Checklist" section in CLAUDE.md, or to the README's Setup section,
whichever already exists in the project.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
CHECK 4 — IMPLEMENTATION DRIFT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

For every recent change (since the last `/sync-docs` run, or the
last ~10 commits if no prior run):

- Does the change introduce behavior that contradicts something in
  CLAUDE.md or the README?
- Does the change introduce a new design decision or invariant that
  should be captured?
- Does the change change a command, deploy step, or runtime
  expectation that the docs still describe in the old way?

OUTPUT — DOCUMENTATION DRIFT REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

---DOCUMENTATION DRIFT REPORT---

CLAUDE.md STALE ENTRIES:
- [entry] | [evidence the code has diverged] | [proposed update or deletion]
(or "None")

CLAUDE.md MISSING ENTRIES:
- [topic] | [why it should be documented] | [proposed wording]
(or "None")

SUBSYSTEM REFERENCE FIXES:
- [subsystem] | [file path no longer exists / new file unassigned] | [fix]
(or "None")

OPERATOR STATE ITEMS NOT DOCUMENTED:
- [step] | [where the code assumes it has been done] | [proposed checklist line]
(or "None")

IMPLEMENTATION DRIFT:
- [commit / area] | [what the docs say] | [what the code now does] | [fix]
(or "None")

PROPOSED CHANGES (file-by-file):
- [file] | [change] | [rationale]

After the report, ask for approval before writing any files. Apply
only the approved changes; do not bundle unapproved suggestions.
